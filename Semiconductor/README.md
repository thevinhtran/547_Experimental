# Metal-Semiconductor Junction as a Schottky Diode 

For this experiment, we fabricated a gold/titanium-Silicon junction which acts as a Schottky diode. At the metal-semiconductor interface, a potential barrier forms which allows for current to flow easily in one direction but restricts it in the other direction, ie, a diode. 

We investigated this rectifying diode behavior by wiring the junction to a PPMS puck and measuring the current through the junction as a function of applied voltage (both reverse and forward biases) as well as temperature. The temperature dependence was controlled by means of a physical property measurement system or PPMS and temperatures as low as 20 K were probed. 

The data collected is stored here in the Data folder. 

From the data collected, we can perform various fits, the most significant of which being a linearized logarithm fit (Johnson plot) that allows for the determination of the Schottky barrier height as one of the fitted parameters.
