**Raw Data** 

Here we have data files collected from our measurements in two folders: probe station and PPMS. The data files give current values as a function of reverse and forward bias current. 
  - The probe station folder consists of measurements done at the probe station, ie, measurements of the wafer/junction performed at room temperature prior to using silver paste
  - The PPMS folder consists of measurements taken of the sample in the PPMS which allows for probing of lower temperatures. We go from 295K down to 20K. The PPMS data ranges from -5V to 5V.
