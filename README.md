## **Experimental Nanoscale Physics**

This is a repository for data analysis notebooks done in Jupyter for three experiments conducted in 547 Experimental Nanoscale physics.

In this course, we performed three hands on experiments investigating properties of physical systems, collected data, and analyzed the results. 
  - **Semiconductor Experiment:** Investigating the current vs voltage behavior of a metal-semiconductor junction (in this case: Gold/Titanium and Silicon)
  -** Graphene Experiment:** Exploring the current as a function of applied back gate voltage for a graphene field effect transistor (that we our selves manufactured) 
  - **Johnson Noise and Equivalent Bandwidth Experiment:** Experimentally verify Johnson noise relationship/dependence on bandwidth
