Raw data files from PPMS, ie, the measurements from -5V to 5V, at varying temperatures done on September 28, 2021. File names indicate channel, temperature, and maximum voltage. 
- Channel 1 refers to positive bias data. 50 points were sampled from 0V to 5V. 
- Channel 2 refers to negative bias. 50 points sampled from -5V to 0V. 
- The "together" files indicate txt files with channel 2 data and channel 1 data combined (in that order, so it goes from -5V to 5V) for plotting/data analysis. 

Majority of files are named "Channel"_"temperature in K"_"max voltage"
