** Raw Data** 

Here we have data files collected from our measurements in two folders: probe station and PPMS. 
  - The probe station folder consists of measurements done at the probe station, ie, measurements of the wafer/junction performed at room temperature prior to using silver paste
  - The PPMS folder consists of measurements taken of the sample in the PPMS which allows for probing of lower temperatures 

Raw data (Current values as a function of applied voltage) for semiconductor experiment collected for Au-Ti/Silicon junction collected in two places: 
physical property measurement system (PPMS) and probe-test station. 

PPMS data ranges from -5V to 5V at varying temperatures.
