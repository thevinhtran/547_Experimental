# Graphene Experiment

## Theoretical Background 

## Procedure 
For this experiment we:
  - Fabricated a graphene field effect transistor and investigated the dependence of resistivity on applied gate voltage 
  - We mechanically exfoliated highly oriented graphite onto an n-type doped silicon wafer to obtain samples of graphene 
  - Then we prepared the transistor by a photolithography process where we applied photo-resist and then exposed the photoresist to UV light and developed the wafer in preparation for deposition of gold and lift off 
  - Finally, upon completion of the transistor fabrication, we measured the resistivity of the sample as a function of applied backgate voltage.
