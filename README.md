### Experimental Nanoscale Physics

Repository for data analysis notebooks done in Jupyter for three experiments conducted in 547 Experimental Nanoscale physics.

The three experiments were
  - Investigating the current vs voltage behavior of a metal-semiconductor junction (in this case: Gold/Titanium and Silicon)
  - Exploring the current as a function of applied back gate voltage for a graphene field effect transistor (that we our selves manufactured) 
  - Experimentally verify Johnson noise relationship/dependence on bandwidth
